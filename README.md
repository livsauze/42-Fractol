## DESCRIPTION
Using the minilibx (the 42 graphic library), this is one of the first graphical project at 42 School!

## MANDATORY PART
For the mandatory part, you need to implement two fractals : mandelbrot and julia. 
Using a "simple" mathematic equation, you will create some beautiful psychedelic effects.

## BONUS PART

## RUNING FRACTOL

First you need to compile the program using :
```make```

 Then you need to choose between 2 fractals set :
 - Mandelbrot : ```./fractol <mandelbrot>```
 - Julia : ```./fractol <julia> <starting_values>```
Choose starting values between -2.0 and 2.0 !
